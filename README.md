##  Overview
This project focuses on **Big Data ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processing and Machine Learning** using **Apache Spark, Ray, and Hadoop**. It includes data ingestion, transformation, and predictive modeling with **Random Forest Regression**.

We designed a **scalable, distributed system** to handle large datasets stored in **HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System)**, perform ETL operations, and train machine learning models using Spark & Ray.
